# **HAPPY FUN TIME CODING CHALLENGES**

The goal of this happy fun time is for us to challenge ourselves with coding algorithms, share our solutions, and explain the nuances between the different languages we chose to write solutions in.

Each week we will be assigned a problem or two and we are to come up with a solution. The following week we will reconvene and discuss our solutions. Some good sites for these types of problems:
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
- [Top Coder](http://topcoder.com/)
- [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/)

The following week we will talk about our solutions, why they are better for Big O, how they are implemented differently because of language, etc. We will also choose a problem(s) for the next round.


**Instructions:**
- Locate this weeks folder in repo
- Read problem statement(s) in folder
- Create new file in folder ex. last-name.py
- Code solution and test against test cases in your file.
- Commit your code
